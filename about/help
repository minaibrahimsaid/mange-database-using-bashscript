Syntax:

a) general commands:

  1) To log into the MAF shell use the command:
    maf [user_name]  (followed by carriege return)
  
    you'll be prompted to enter your password, for the sake of trial, you can use username : fahd and password : 789 or amr : 789
  
  2) to preview databases in the system use the command:
    show [databases]
    can be followed by a semicolon or not
   
  3) to use a certain db:
    use [database_name];
    
  4) to get the description of a table, first use the database that contain it and use the command:
    desc [table_name];
  
  5) to clear the shell:
      clear
      
  6) to logout from the database:
    logout
    or alternatively,
    q

  7) to get help with the functions use the command:
    help
    
    note: help is still being developed and will not yet be as helpful as this readme file
 
b) User managment commands:
  1) to add a user:
    useradd [user_name];
  
  2) to change password:
    passwd [user_name];
    
  3) to remove a user:
    userdel [user_name];
  
  4) to switch users:
    su [user_name];
    
        you'll be prompted to enter your password, for the sake of trial, you can use username : fahd and password : 789 or amr : 789

c) DDL (Data definition Language):

  1) to create a db use the command:
    create database [database_name];

  2) to create a table use the command:
    create table [table_name] ([field_name][data_type][options],[field_name][data_type][options]);
  
  3) to drop a table use the command:
    drop table [table_name];
  
  4) to modify table structure (adding or removimg columns):
    alter table [table_name] add column [column_name] [data_type] [options...];
    alter table [table_name] drop column [column_name];
    alter table [table_name] set [field_name] [option]=[value];  
    # for data types use int or varchar, for a_i (auto_increment), nall (sets the field as nullable), unique (doesn't accept    repeated value) and pk (primary_key) the value would be 1 for teuw or 0 for false.
  
d) DML (Data Management Language):
  1) to update all records of a column:
    update [table_name] set [field_name]=[value];
   
  2) to add conditions to the update query:
    update [table_name] set [field_name]=[value] where ([field_name]=[value]);
    
  3) to insert a new record into a table:
    insert into [table_name] ([field_name]=[value], [field_name]=[value]);
    
  4) to delete all records in a table:
    delete from [table_name];
    
  5) to delete a certain record in a table:
    delete from [table_name] where [field_name]=[value];
    
 e) DQL (Data Query Language):
 
  1) to select fields of a record:
    select -a from [table_name];
  
  2) to specify conditions with the select statment:
    select [field_name],[field_name] from [table_name] where ([select_option][field_name]=[value]);

    [select_option] can be [-and] if searching with a word or the user wants to make an anding of the result. Alternativly it can be [-rx] if the user wishes to search for a regex.


areas of future enhancement:

1) all errors are numberd and saved in the error.sh file which in the next release will manage to convert error number to an error message to be echoed.
2) adding permissions to users on specific databases and tables.
3) making an installation package instead of user having to add the $PATH manually.
4) security wasn't a priority in this project for the sake of studying and it needs to be improved.
